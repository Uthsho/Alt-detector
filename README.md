# What is this bot?
This is a discord.py bot built to detect any new account that joins your server.

# So how does it work?
The bot logs all the member joins in a separate channel and notifies the staff if any new account joins.

# Does it trace alts with 100% accuracy?
Ofcourse no, on Discord, there is practically no way you can trace alts with 100% accuracy. But if the alternative account is a newly built, the bot can identify it and notify the staff. Here's a catch too, the account obviously has a chance to be an actual new discord user. In that case, your intelligent staff who were just notified will sort it out.

# How does it help me then?
The bot makes your job a **LOT** easier by notifying your staff. There won't be a single new account sneaking up your server without you and your staff knowing when this bot is on watch.

# Now what do I need before setting up the bot?

Pre-requisits:
- Python 3.6 *anything above version 3.6 will work*
- Discord.py *after installing python, use `pip install discord`*
- A good editor to edit the codes. *For example: Visual studio code, PyCharm etc.*

# I have those, how do I get the bot up and running?
This part is simple, open `settings.json` using your editor, and place the values.
When you're done with it, run the `main.py` file or use `python main.py` from your terminal to run the bot.
If the bot replies ** `The bot is ready.` ** in the terminal, well you know what it means..
